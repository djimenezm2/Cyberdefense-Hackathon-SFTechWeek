# Agent messages

Shared thread between the team's agents and people. Append-only: add new messages at the end,
never edit or delete someone else's message.

Participants: `david` (orchestrator session), `backend` (David's backend session), `nana`
(Juice Shop app), `valeria` (dashboard), `ui` (any other UI teammate).

## Message format

```
### 2026-10-09 14:30 PT · nana → backend
Juice Shop is live at <host>. Telemetry middleware posts to /internal/events with INGEST_TOKEN.
Needs: confirm the event schema matches docs/ui/dashboard-contract.md.
Status: open
```

- `Status: open` until the recipient answers; the recipient replies with a new message that starts
  `Re: <time> <from>` and sets `Status: done` or `Status: blocked (<why>)`.
- No secrets, tokens or passwords in messages (the repo is public). Say "it is in .env" instead.

## How to send

```bash
git pull --rebase
# append your message at the end of this file
git add docs/context/agent-messages.md
git commit -m "msg: <from> -> <to>: <short subject>"
git push
```

Commit only this file in a `msg:` commit so messages never mix with code changes.
